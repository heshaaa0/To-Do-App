# To-Do-App

This system has 3 main components, the database, the backend API, and the frontend  
UI.  
   
 
• Todo tasks are stored in the database, under a table named “task”. You can decide on 
what columns should be in the “task” table.  
• Backend should comprise with a REST API that facilitates the user operations. You can 
decide on how the REST API should be designed.  
• Frontend should be a simple SPA.  
• All components should be able to run using Docker. You can use `docker-compose` to 
start the 3 containers accordingly.
